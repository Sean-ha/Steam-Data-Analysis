    "# Introduction (((((WIP))))))))\n",
    "The video games industry is larger than it has ever been, with a global market value of over \\\\$100 billion. In 2021, it is expected to reach approximately \\\\$140 billion. There are various devices through which these games are distributed, including computers, game consoles, and smartphones. For each of these devices, there usually exist various storefronts through which games are sold. Examples of this include the Apple App Store for Apple devices, the Google Play Store for Android devices, the PlayStation Store for PlayStation consoles, and Steam for PCs. While there exist many other storefronts for PCs, we will be focusing our analysis on Steam, as it is currently the largest PC digital distributor for games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing video games takes lots of time and money. If we could analyze data of existing games, we could perhaps reach conclusions about what types of games would be the most successful, or profitable, and minimize the chances of developing a game that will not sell particularly well. If you were a game designer or a manager at a game studio, you very well might be interested in this sort of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent times, through technological advancements and innovations, the barrier of entry for making a game has been drastically lowered. As a result, there has been a surge of \"indie\" game developers (usually classified by a small development team, that does not have the financial support of a large game publisher). These indie game developers are usually short on cash, and are relying on the success of their project to stay afloat. This type of data might be very useful to these kinds of people, as it could help them make an informed decision about what type of game to develop, and specific factors to think about, as opposed to taking a shot in the dark."

What we what to extract is the number of languages that a particular game supports. In addition, we will want to take a look at some major languages, and see what impact they might have on the success of a game. We could hypothetically perform this on every single language, but since there are so many, we will limit our analysis to a few major ones. If you are interested in a particular language that I do not include, feel free to try it out yourself and see what kind of results you get!\n",
