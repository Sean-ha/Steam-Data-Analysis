    "# Introduction (((((WIP))))))))\n",
    "The video games industry is larger than it has ever been, with a global market value of over \\\\$100 billion. In 2021, it is expected to reach approximately \\\\$140 billion. There are various devices through which these games are distributed, including computers, game consoles, and smartphones. For each of these devices, there usually exist various storefronts through which games are sold. Examples of this include the Apple App Store for Apple devices, the Google Play Store for Android devices, the PlayStation Store for PlayStation consoles, and Steam for PCs. While there exist many other storefronts for PCs, we will be focusing our analysis on Steam, as it is currently the largest PC digital distributor for games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing video games takes lots of time and money. If we could analyze data of existing games, we could perhaps reach conclusions about what types of games would be the most successful, or profitable, and minimize the chances of developing a game that will not sell particularly well. If you were a game designer or a manager at a game studio, you very well might be interested in this sort of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent times, through technological advancements and innovations, the barrier of entry for making a game has been drastically lowered. As a result, there has been a surge of \"indie\" game developers (usually classified by a small development team, that does not have the financial support of a large game publisher). These indie game developers are usually short on cash, and are relying on the success of their project to stay afloat. This type of data might be very useful to these kinds of people, as it could help them make an informed decision about what type of game to develop, and specific factors to think about, as opposed to taking a shot in the dark."

What we what to extract is the number of languages that a particular game supports. In addition, we will want to take a look at some major languages, and see what impact they might have on the success of a game. We could hypothetically perform this on every single language, but since there are so many, we will limit our analysis to a few major ones.

If we just take a look at the first few rows, it looks like there is a clear format. However, there are many observations that do not follow this format even slightly, making it very difficult to work with. For example, some values include 'Nov 1 2000', which is the standard format, but other values can include: 'Feb 2011', 'Coming Soon', 'TBA', 'Fall 2016', and even some extraordinary ones like 'The League of Evil is preparing its evil plans...'.

This is a relatively easy solution to implement that is able to extract the meaningful data from the ReleaseDate column, even with all of the variation. In addition, the year value is arguably the most important part of the ReleaseDate, and it is a number that most ReleaseDate strings include, even if they do not include a month or day.\n",

    "Now we will merge the two datasets so that it is all in one centralized DataFrame. First, we need to be able to match a column in one DataFrame with a column in another. We will do this by game name. To make sure subtle differences in game names are ignored, we will standardize each game name. We will do this by making all game names uppercase, removing and special characters they might contain, and removing all spaces between words. In addition, some names might contain the substring \"(r)\" or \"(tm)\" which also should be removed. Let's do it."

    "Now we have successfully merged the data from play_df into one DataFrame, df. Note that as the number of buyers increases, the playtime will naturally increase. We want to see the average playtime of a typical player, regardless of how popular a game is. We will find this by taking TotalPlaytime / TotalBuyers. We will create a new column to store this value for each row. Let's call this new column 'AveragePlaytime'."

    "Looking at this correlation matrix, there do not seem to be any outstanding results. It is generally what we would expect. The RecommendationCount naturally increases as the number of player (SteamSpyPlayersEstimate) increases. And of course TotalBuyers and SteamSpyOwners are heavily correlated as well, since they are essentially measuring the same thing.\n",

    "However, this does raise a good point. We care more about the percentage of the playerbase that recommends a game as opposed to the total number of recommendations it received. Therefore, very popular games would not be heavily skewed by having naturally having tons of recommendations, since they have tons of players. Let's make this change. In addition, since TotalBuyers and SteamSpyOwners are essentially measuring the same thing, we will remove the TotalBuyers column and use the SteamSpyOwners column to represent the number of owners of each game."
